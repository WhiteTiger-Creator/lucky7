# Database Replication Failover Review Log
Security operations — governance archive for the failed database replication-failover rollout (2026-Q1 through 2026-Q2).

## Executive Summary
The drift reconciler has produced unsafe containment queues since the February recovery rollout. How the reconciler is *meant* to behave — canonicalization, deduplication, window merging, the four attenuation layers and their scope rules, probe scoring, the risk ledger, replica topology traversal, queue admission, priority and ordering — was settled incrementally by the recovery governance board, and those decisions live in the review entries below, not in any single summary. The February recovery draft proposals were revisited during the 2026-05 governance review and several were reversed; where a draft proposal and a later decision disagree, the later decision governs, and where a decision was itself revised by a still-later one, the latest dated decision is binding — trace each rule to its final entry. `/app/docs/report_spec.json` is the output contract only: it fixes file paths, schemas, required fields, digest payloads and checksum serialization, not how the values are derived.

## February Recovery Drafts (2026-02 — partly reversed)
The initial rollout circulated compile-behavior proposals through #DB tickets in the 4800 range. Several did not survive governance review. They are archived in place below and marked superseded; do not implement them as written.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-02 - #DB-5302)** Yusuf: deduplication by alert_id (final, revising #DB-5209 which kept the first-seen row): keep highest end_ms; tie-break by severity rank p1>p2>p3>p4, then longer normalized signature, then lexicographically larger normalized env; if still tied keep first seen row in input order. This supersedes #DB-4815.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-14 - #DB-5342)** Yusuf: duplicate-severity precedence is REVERSED. Replication-drift duplicates are largely re-emissions from the failover watchdog, which raises the severity of a repeated alert before an operator has confirmed it, so keeping the highest severity was systematically over-escalating the recovery queue. Where two rows share an `alert_id` and tie on `end_ms`, the row with the LOWER severity rank is now kept: p4 beats p3, p3 beats p2, p2 beats p1. Only this comparison changes. The rest of the #DB-5302 chain runs unchanged and in the same order after it: then longer normalized signature, then lexicographically larger normalized env, then first seen in input order. This reverses that step of #DB-5302.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-03 - #DB-5304)** Lena: drift windows group by normalized env; merge condition: next.start_ms <= current.end_ms + 45. Muted alerts are excluded from window construction. This supersedes #DB-4819 and revises the +30 stitch in #DB-5211.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-17 - #DB-5348)** Lena: drift-window stitch threshold retuned (final, revising #DB-5304). Replication drift on a failed-over replica re-emerges in bursts a little further apart than the original 45 ms allowance assumed, so consecutive alerts were being split into separate windows that responders then had to re-merge by hand. The merge condition becomes `next.start_ms <= current.end_ms + 60`. The comparison stays inclusive, so a gap of exactly 60 ms merges and a gap of 61 ms does not. Everything else in #DB-5304 — grouping by normalized env, the exclusion of muted alerts from window construction — is unchanged.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-04 - #DB-5308)** Priya: rotation layer: scope allowlist ['all', 'p1', 'p2']; normalize env/scope/start/end, keep rows whose severity_scope is in scope_values, drop end<=start, compact overlap/touch intervals per (env,severity_scope). Matching scopes: {all,max_severity} for each window; if max_severity is p2 and (env,p2) has no compacted intervals, borrow (env,p1) as the severity scope fallback. Union: collect overlap segments from matching scopes then compact/union those segments to compute rotation_overlap_ms and rotation_segment_count. dispatchable_duration_ms = max(risk_adjusted_duration_ms - (rotation_overlap_ms // 3), 0) — the //3 divisor is final and revises #DB-5217 and the //2 form in #DB-5218. volatility_index (final, revising #DB-5219 which dropped the probe terms): stability_pressure_score + (all_rotation_probe_ms//24) + (severity_rotation_probe_ms//16) + (rotation_segment_count*2) where probe is [end_ms-240,end_ms+1). NOTE: this layer does not stand alone — the reopen/rotation shared time is reassigned by #DB-5354, which governs the interaction. ROUNDING: rotation_overlap // 3 = FLOOR.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-23 - #DB-5354)** Nadia: reopen/rotation precedence. The two scoped layers were being charged independently, so an instant covered by both an approved reopen window and an approved rotation window was attenuating the drift twice — once in each layer — which understated the actionable time on exactly the windows operators care about. Compute each layer's half-open scoped segments and compact them as before, then assign the intersection to REOPEN: `reopen_overlap_ms` keeps its full compacted union, and `rotation_overlap_ms` is its own compacted union MINUS the duration of the reopen/rotation intersection, floored at zero. Reopen therefore wins the shared time. The defer layer is not part of this rule and keeps its independent union, so the three layers must not be assumed to interact alike. The rounding of each subtraction is unchanged and still governed by its own entry.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-25 - #DB-5358)** Nadia: trust contention (final). Each origin's `trust_exposure_score` is computed independently, so a target env reachable from several origins is currently counted by every one of them. A target reachable from MORE THAN ONE origin is charged to exactly ONE of them. For each such contended target, take the origins that reach it (its claimants) and pick the OWNER: the claimant whose strongest bounded simple-path score TO THAT TARGET is highest, ties broken by lexicographically smallest origin name. Note this is the per-target path score, NOT the origin's overall `trust_exposure_score` -- the two pick different owners. The owner adds that same per-target score to its own `trust_exposure_score`; every other claimant adds nothing for that target, and a target reachable from exactly one origin is not contended and adds nothing to anybody. The bonus is folded in BEFORE `trust_path_digest` is taken, so the digest commits to the attributed score. `trust_reachable_envs` and `trust_strongest_path` are unaffected: attribution changes what an origin SCORES, never what it reaches. Worked example: target t is reached by origins a (path score 9) and b (path score 4); a owns t and adds 9 to its own score, b adds 0, and t still appears in both origins' `trust_reachable_envs`.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-06 - #DB-5313)** Yusuf: risk ledger: state is independent per normalized env; process each env's merged windows in start_ms ascending order after all four attenuation layers are complete. First window: idle_gap_ms=0, carry_in_ms=0. idle_gap_ms: for later windows max(current.start_ms-previous.end_ms,0). carry_in_ms = max(previous.carry_out_ms-(idle_gap_ms//2),0). ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms = actionable_duration_ms+(carry_in_ms//4). carry_out_ms = min(carry_in_ms+actionable_duration_ms+(rotation_segment_count*15)+(defer_segment_count*10),2000). finalize carry_out_ms for one window before evaluating the next window in the same env. The //2 idle decay and the 2000 cap are final and revise #DB-5224. This supersedes #DB-4835. ROUNDING: idle_gap_ms // 2 = FLOOR. ROUNDING: carry_in_ms // 4 = FLOOR.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-17 - #DB-5346)** Yusuf: risk-ledger carry-out cap retuned (final, revising #DB-5313). The 2000 ms cap recorded there was set before the failover backlog was measured and never actually bound, which let a single long-running env accumulate carry without limit across a recovery shift. The cap is now 921 ms: `carry_out_ms = min(<computed carry>, 921)`. The cap is applied after the computed value, so a window whose computed carry is exactly 921 is unaffected and one above it is clamped down to 921. The `//2` idle decay, the carry-in formula and the ledger-adjusted credit recorded in #DB-5313 are unchanged.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-08 - #DB-5319)** Priya: trust retention: for each reachable target retain the path with greatest path_score; on equal score retain the lexicographically smallest full node sequence. trust_reachable_envs: all retained target names sorted ascending. trust_exposure_score (final, revising #DB-5229 and the earlier per-target sum which double-counted shared hops): the maximum total weight of a set of **node-disjoint** bounded simple directed paths out of the origin env. Enumerate every simple directed path of 1, 2, or 3 edges from the origin — a path's weight is the sum of its edge weights and its node set is the non-origin envs it visits — then choose a subset of those paths that pairwise share **no** non-origin env, maximising the summed weight; the empty selection scores 0. This is NOT the sum of each reachable target's strongest path: two paths that reuse an env (even reaching different targets) cannot both be counted, so the exposure is the best node-disjoint packing. Use 0 when no target is reachable. trust_strongest_path: among retained target paths choose greatest path_score, then lexicographically smallest full node sequence; use [origin_env] when no target is reachable.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-09 - #DB-5322)** Marek: queue admission: minimum ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms per max_severity is {'p1': 222, 'p2': 242}; admitted severities are ['p1', 'p2']. These floors are inclusive (a window whose ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms equals its floor is admitted) and they are final, revising the looser 180/225 pair circulated during the March review.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-18 - #DB-5350)** Priya: recovery policy baseline. Every threshold the reconciler applies is a policy value, not a global constant, and is read from `/app/data/recovery_policies.json` at that fixed absolute path — `--input` selects the alert stream only and never relocates the policy file. The approved baseline, used for any field the policy file does not supply, is: `admission_min_p1` = 222; `admission_min_p2` = 242; `critical_p1_ledger_min` = 437; `critical_ledger_min` = 550; `critical_stability_min` = 33; `critical_trust_min` = 35; `high_ledger_min` = 407; `high_risk_adjusted_min` = 340; `high_dispatchable_min` = 320; `high_duration_min` = 420; `high_trust_min` = 12; `carry_out_cap` = 921; `stitch_gap_ms` = 60. These supersede the corresponding literals recorded in #DB-5304, #DB-5313, #DB-5322 and #DB-5344, which are retained only as the baseline values above.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-18 - #DB-5352)** Priya: policy resolution, applied per normalized env in three layers. Start from the approved baseline of #DB-5350. Overlay every field the policy file's `default` object supplies — it may differ from the baseline and it need not be complete, so a field it omits keeps its baseline value. Then overlay every field that env's entry in `env_overrides` supplies. An override is never a complete policy: it names only the fields it changes and inherits the rest from the layer beneath it, so an env listing one field differs from the resolved default in that one field alone. An env with no entry in `env_overrides` resolves to the overlaid default. Coerce every policy value with the same millisecond coercion used elsewhere. `policy_checksum` is the SHA-256 hex digest of one line per resolved policy — first `default`, then each env named in `env_overrides` in ascending name order — each line being the env name followed by the thirteen field values in the order they are listed in #DB-5350, joined by `|`, lines joined by a single newline with no trailing newline, hashed over UTF-8.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-09 - #DB-5323)** Marek: priority rules: critical — max_severity == p1 and ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms >= 235, or ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms >= 500, or stability_index >= 20, or trust_exposure_score >= 24. high — ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms >= 265, or alert_count >= 3 with max_severity in {p1,p2}, or rotation_segment_count == 0 with risk_adjusted_duration_ms >= 340, or defer_pressure_score > 0 with dispatchable_duration_ms >= 320, or reopen_segment_count == 0 with duration_ms >= 420, or trust_exposure_score >= 12. Otherwise otherwise.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-16 - #DB-5344)** Marek: priority thresholds retuned (final, revising #DB-5323). The recovery review found the critical cutoffs were absorbing almost the whole queue, so the high tier never applied and responders lost the distinction entirely. Critical now requires: max_severity == p1 with ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms >= 437; or ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms >= 550; or stability_index >= 33; or trust_exposure_score >= 35. High, evaluated only when critical does not hold, now requires: ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms >= 407; or alert_count >= 2 with max_severity in {p1, p2}; or rotation_segment_count == 0 with risk_adjusted_duration_ms >= 340; or defer_pressure_score > 0 with dispatchable_duration_ms >= 320; or reopen_segment_count == 0 with duration_ms >= 420; or trust_exposure_score >= 12.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-10 - #DB-5325)** Yusuf: final queue ordering, applied strictly in sequence: priority rank critical>high>medium; then ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms desc; then actionable_duration_ms desc; then stability_index desc; then trust_exposure_score desc; then defer_pressure_score desc; then volatility_index desc; then dispatchable_duration_ms desc; then risk_adjusted_duration_ms desc; then freeze_segment_count desc; then alert_count desc; then env asc; then start_ms asc.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-24 - #DB-5356)** Marek: responder capacity cap. A single environment was filling the recovery queue and starving the others, so the queue is now capped at THREE rows per normalized env. The cap is applied as a final pass over the fully ordered queue, not during admission and not per env before ordering: build the queue, admit and prioritise every window as before, apply the complete ordering chain of #DB-5325, and only then walk the ordered queue from the top keeping the first three rows of each env and discarding the rest. Which rows survive therefore depends on the global order, so a window that would rank fourth within its env is dropped even when it outranks a retained row from another env. The discarded rows are not re-admitted anywhere and do not contribute to any queue-derived summary field.

### Review entry 0451 — core lane
> **Governance decision (2026-05-10 - #DB-5327)** Yusuf: summary score aggregation domains (final, revising #DB-5231): the six `max_*` **score** fields — `max_stability_pressure_score`, `max_volatility_index`, `max_defer_pressure_score`, `max_ledger_pressure_score`, `max_trust_exposure_score`, and `max_stability_index` — are maxima over the **final admitted response_queue rows only**, using 0 when the queue is empty. Only `max_carry_out_ms` is taken over **every drift window** (admitted or not), 0 when there are no windows. The earlier all-windows form for the score fields in #DB-5231 counted attenuated windows that never reach a responder and is not the shipped behavior; this matches the `maximum_aggregation_domains` split in report_spec.json.

### Review entry 0731 — probe bench
> **Governance decision (2026-05-14 - #DB-5332)** Rosa: recovery-probe review found the severity-scoped half of the stability probe was systematically under-counting partial probe windows, because a scoped overlap shorter than one full divisor step scored zero. That term therefore ROUNDS UP: `stability_pressure_score = (all_probe_ms // 30) + ceil(severity_probe_ms / 20) + max(alert_count - 1, 0)`. Only the severity-scoped term rounds up; the `all`-scoped term keeps its floor, and the alert-count term is unchanged. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/20) is -(-x // 20). This revises the floored severity term recorded in #DB-5307. ROUNDING: all_probe_ms // 30 = FLOOR. ROUNDING: severity_probe_ms // 20 = CEIL.

### Review entry 0733 — probe bench
> **Governance decision (2026-05-14 - #DB-5334)** Rosa: the same under-count applies to the rotation probe, and is corrected the same way: `volatility_index = stability_pressure_score + (all_rotation_probe_ms // 24) + ceil(severity_rotation_probe_ms / 16) + (rotation_segment_count * 2)`. The `all`-scoped rotation term stays floored and the segment term is unchanged. This revises the floored severity term recorded in #DB-5308. ROUNDING: all_rotation_probe_ms // 24 = FLOOR. ROUNDING: severity_rotation_probe_ms // 16 = CEIL.

### Review entry 0735 — probe bench
> **Governance decision (2026-05-15 - #DB-5336)** Marek: defer probe, same correction: `defer_pressure_score = (all_defer_probe_ms // 40) + ceil(severity_defer_probe_ms / 28) + defer_segment_count`. The `all`-scoped defer term stays floored. This revises the floored severity term recorded in #DB-5310. ROUNDING: all_defer_probe_ms // 40 = FLOOR. ROUNDING: severity_defer_probe_ms // 28 = CEIL.

### Review entry 0737 — ledger bench
> **Governance decision (2026-05-15 - #DB-5338)** Yusuf: the carry-in half of the ledger pressure score suffered the same partial-step loss, so it rounds up while the carry-out half does not: `ledger_pressure_score = (carry_out_ms // 80) + ceil(carry_in_ms / 120) + max(alert_count - 1, 0)`. The 80 carry-out divisor and the alert term recorded in #DB-5314 are unchanged, and the worked example in that entry predates this correction. This revises the floored carry-in term in #DB-5314. ROUNDING: carry_out_ms // 80 = FLOOR. ROUNDING: carry_in_ms // 120 = CEIL.

### Review entry 0739 — probe bench
> **Governance decision (2026-05-15 - #DB-5340)** Yusuf: recording the rounding map settled across #DB-5332, #DB-5334, #DB-5336 and #DB-5338 for the avoidance of doubt: rounding is NOT uniform across the pipeline and no layer's rounding may be inferred from another's. Each divisor's direction is fixed by its own governing decision and must be read there.

## Late governance close-out (2026-05 recovery review, final)

> **Governance decision (2026-05-28 - #DB-5360)** Yusuf: risk-ledger carry-chain rounding, final. Re-measuring the failover backlog showed the floored carry chain was shedding a partial step at both the idle-gap decay and the carry-in credit, so BOTH now ROUND UP (ceiling): `carry_in_ms = max(previous.carry_out_ms - ceil(idle_gap_ms / 2), 0)` and `ledger_adjusted_actionable_ms = actionable_duration_ms + ceil(carry_in_ms / 4)`. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/n) is -(-x // n). This is final and revises the floored `idle_gap_ms // 2` and `carry_in_ms // 4` recorded in #DB-5313 — and reaffirmed as unchanged in #DB-5346 — on those two rounding points only: the per-env ordering, the idle-gap and carry-in formulas, the 921 ms carry-out cap from #DB-5346, and the carry-out composition are all unchanged. The #DB-5313 and #DB-5314 worked examples predate this correction and floor both terms, so their carry figures are stale on this point. ROUNDING: idle_gap_ms // 2 = CEIL. ROUNDING: carry_in_ms // 4 = CEIL.

> **Governance decision (2026-05-29 - #DB-5362)** Yusuf: ledger pressure rounding, final. The carry-OUT half of the ledger pressure score suffered the same partial-step loss as the carry-in half did in #DB-5338, so it now ROUNDS UP as well and BOTH ledger-pressure halves ceil: `ledger_pressure_score = ceil(carry_out_ms / 80) + ceil(carry_in_ms / 120) + max(alert_count - 1, 0)`. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/80) is -(-x // 80). This is final and revises the floored `carry_out_ms // 80` recorded in #DB-5314 and left floored in #DB-5338, on that one rounding point only: the 80 carry-out divisor, the 120 carry-in ceiling and the alert term are unchanged. The #DB-5314 worked example predates this correction and floors the carry-out half (it shows 450 // 80 = 5, whereas the final ceiling gives 6), so that figure is stale on this point. ROUNDING: carry_out_ms // 80 = CEIL.
